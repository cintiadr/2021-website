# Hello speakers!

Thank you so much for speaking at PyConline AU this year! We know you're super busy getting ready to present, but we have a few things we need you to read through!

Because we're online, things are a bit different! We know there's a lot covered, but please read everything here closely.

## Video uploads

Some time after the event, if you've given us permission to, we'll upload the video from your talk to YouTube. These videos will be published under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.

## What to do if something comes up

Sometimes things happen!

Laptops run out of power, slides go missing, family stuff comes up, physical or mental health problems can occur. If anything comes up at any point, please let Benno (our Program Chair) or one of the other conference organisers know. We have an experienced organising team who can help with a broad range of questions, issues, or concerns. The sooner you let us know if there is a problem, the sooner we can work with you to achieve the best possible outcome.

If youâ€™re just unsure and need to clarify something, email [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au).

If you have an issue that should involve our Safety Team, contact details will be made available at the event. Less immediate issues of Conduct can be emailed to [safety@pycon.org.au](mailto:safety@pycon.org.au).
