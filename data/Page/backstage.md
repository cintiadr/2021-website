# Backstage @ PyConline AU

*This page outlines the tools, the tech, and the key moments involved in presenting at PyConline AU 2021.*

There are four systems you'll have access to throughout the course of the event:

* **Discord** is our backstage chat system. It's where coordination between speakers, organisers and the AV team will happen.
* **Venueless** is our attendee platform. It's where you'll interact with everyone else attending the conference.
* **StreamYard** is our streaming platform. You'll be given access to this through Discord at the appropriate time, and it's where you'll go when you're live on stream.
* **Next Day Video Presenter Portal** is where you'll book a Tech Check during August, and where you upload video if you're pre-recording.

You'll gain access to both Discord and Venueless through your ticket! The order confirmation screen has all the links you need to get in.

* **If you haven't redeemed your ticket yet**, look for an email with the subject *[PyConline AU 2021] Your speaker ticket for PyConline AU 2021*, sent around July 14 2021. Then, follow the prompts to redeem your ticket.

As an outline, these are the key dates, times and locations that are important for presenting at the conference.

## About Discord
Discord is our ‘back of house’ space, where we have been organising things leaving up to the event

### How do I get in to Discord?


* Redeem your speaker ticket voucher. You'll have an email with the subject *[PyConline AU 2021] Your speaker ticket for PyConline AU 2021*, sent around July 14, 2021. 
* Once you have redeemed your ticket, in the Pretix page, click the link that says *Log me in to the backstage Discord server!*

If you have already redeemed your speaker ticket voucher, instead search your email for an email with the subject *[PyConline AU 2021] Your order*.

### What do I need to do once I'm in?

There are two important discord settings we’re asking you to enable for PyConline:

 * **Set your server nickname to your full name** (not your gamer tag).  Organisers, AV volunteers and MC’s need to know who you are in discord.
 * **Enable notifications just for the conference.** Our conference team need to be able to send you notifications if you’re missing from a channel.

You can set these settings per-server by clicking on the server name in the top left of discord. These won’t affect other servers you use Discord on.

### What do I do if I need Discord help?

* **If you can log in to Discord successfully, and the Discord server is active**, post in the **#help-me** channel.
* **If you can't get in to Discord**, email [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au).

## Tech Checks

All presenters (pre-recorded and live) require a Tech Check with our AV crew in August.  Exceptions are if you've presented at a PyConline before (but we'd still encourage it!) or you're submitting a pre-record very early.

Tech checks give our AV an opportunity to check our systems work with your setup, and we'll provide feedback about your webcam, audio, lighting, etc. 

They take approx 10 minutes.

These will run during August and accomodate for various timezones.  We encourage you to book one as early as possible, especially if you are pre-recording.

You will recieve an email from the "Next Day Video Presenter Portal" early July.  The portal contains further instructions, including how to book in your Tech Check.


## Speaker Check In
As with an in-person conference, we do ask speakers ‘check in’ so that we know you’re ‘on-site’ For our extremely online event, we’re asking you to say hi in #speaker-checkin on discord (and mention your scheduled conference channel too) so we can mark you as online for the conference. If you’re only presenting on Saturday it’s absolutely fine to check in on Saturday (though you’re welcome to attend Friday too!)

Ideally, we’re asking speakers to **check in at least 1 hour before their talk**. When you check in, we’ll do a quick secondary tech-check with you just to make sure everything is still working as you planned.

The conference production team have a runsheet that marks you as online (checked in) & tech check’ed (on the day) so that you don’t miss your session.

If you have opted to pre-record your talk we'd love to invite you on the stream for talk introductions and thankyous, so please check in.  Hang out in venueless, but please do check in in discord so we know you’re online.

## Showtime!

It’s now 15 minutes before your scheduled session. It’s ok to be nervous but you’re going to be absolutely fabulous - you’ve got this!

As long as you are online (Discord), a conference staff member will talk through the next steps, including getting you into the streaming platform & asking about session length and if you want to take questions at the end.  This will happen in the appropriate Green Room in Discord (i.e. #greenroom-curlyboi).

Please be mindful of time - your fellow speakers will rely on the 15 minutes between talks to get setup (just as you did). If a talk is running over the scheduled time, the MC may pop back up and politely remind you to wrap up.

##  After your talk
Congratulations! You gave a talk at #PyConlineAU!

Remember to breathe and take some time to decompress. We’d love you to hang out with attendees back in venueless while you watch the next set of talks. If you invited people to ask questions in chat, pop back in to venueless during the 10 minute break and continue that conversation.
