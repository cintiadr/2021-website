Hello speakers!

Thank you so much for speaking at PyConline AU this year! We know you're super busy getting ready to present, but we have a few things we need you to read through!

 Because we're online, things are a bit different! We know there's a lot covered, but please read everything here closely.

{% if type == 'pre-record' %}




{% if type == 'live' %}


## On the day, before your talk

Our community platform will be [Venueless](https://venueless.org); that's where all of our speakers and attendees will be gathering. The videos will feed into there from a video streaming system

- **One hour before** your talk, go into the **green room chat**, and let the channel know you have arrived for a tech check. The AV team will help check your set-up, and give last minute advice.
- **15 minutes before** your talk, the green room AV team will check you are ready. You'll be invited to the streaming backstage for further instructions.


## During your talk

Your talk will run for 30 mins.

Your options for taking questions are:

- Accept questions live on the stream. The MC will curate questions and read them to you. If you choose this option, question time is **included in your talk time**.
- Discuss questions after the talk, via the "hallway" channels we provide (there will be text-only, audio and video options).
- Decline to take questions.

At the 5, 2, and 1 minute marks you'll get a countdown message in the backstage chat. **At the end of your allotted time** the MC will come back on stream, thank you for presenting, and the "virtual curtain" will drop.

**Talks will not be allowed to run over**, so the MC may have to interrupt you if you don't wrap up in time; to avoid this, make sure you have the stream chat open!

## After your talk

As soon as the curtain drops you can leave the studio. (In fact, you'll be encouraged to rather quickly, because our changeover procedures are tight!) We'd love it if you could then go into one of the "hallway track" spaces we provide, but you don't have to.


## Video uploads

Some time after the event, if you've given us permission to, we'll upload the video from your talk to YouTube. These videos will be published under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.

## What to do if something comes up

Sometimes things happen!

Laptops run out of power, slides go missing, family stuff comes up, physical or mental health problems can occur. If anything comes up at any point, please let Benno (our Program Chair) or one of the other conference organisers know. We have an experienced organising team who can help with a broad range of questions, issues, or concerns. The sooner you let us know if there is a problem, the sooner we can work with you to achieve the best possible outcome.

If youâ€™re just unsure and need to clarify something, email [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au).

If you have an issue that should involve our Safety Team, contact details will be made available at the event. Less immediate issues of Conduct can be emailed to [safety@pycon.org.au](mailto:safety@pycon.org.au).
