bio: "<p>I am one of those hybrid-people with many hats, probably best summaries as\
  \ software engineer, tech education, and community and team cultivator.</p>\n<p>Having\
  \ spent the last six years growing the Girlsâ€™ Programming Network from a local delight,\
  \ to a huge nation-spanning operation, I recently founded my own business, ConnectEd\
  \ Code. My aim is to bring project-based tech education opportunities and materials\
  \ to schools and communities groups around Australia through school incursions,\
  \ clubs, holiday programs, teacher PD sessions and more. I am also delighted to\
  \ be a Cambridge Computer Science teacher at Presbyterian Ladies College, as well\
  \ as consultant and speaker in the tech, education, diversity, and project management\
  \ spaces.</p>"
