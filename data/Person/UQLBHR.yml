bio: <p>I first learn programming by taking a course in Fortran when I was a teenager,
  but never had much use for it.  In 2004, while in my 40's, I decided to pick up
  programming as a hobby and creative outlet to distract me from my daily job. Since
  then, I mostly focused on creating programs and programming environments intended
  to help beginners learn my favourite hobby. These include RUR-PLE, Reeborg's World,
  AvantPy, and a few others, the latest being <strong>friendly</strong>.</p>
