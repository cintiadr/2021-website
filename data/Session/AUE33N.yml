abstract: <p>Humanity has made incredible progress across a wide range of measures,
  even as we face massive challenges. But the data for it all is scattered in the
  wind, stuck in excel files of massive organisations, in tiny addendums to research
  papers, and even in government tweets. Roll up your sleeves, we'll dive into initiatives
  by Our World In Data, Gapminder and Wikidata to unlock this data for great good!
  Along the way, we'll learn about the joys and pains of data harmonisation and ask,
  how meta should data really be?</p>
