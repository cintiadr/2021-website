abstract: <p>Learn how to write a Python C extension using pybind11 and package it
  for all major operating systems by building cross-platform wheels.</p>
description: "<p>Have you ever wondered why Python is referred to as CPython and what\
  \ it looks like under the hood? Come to this talk and find out! We'll briefly take\
  \ a look at what Python's source looks like, how it exposes a C-API using which\
  \ we can extend its functionality, and how we can write Python C extensions using\
  \ pybind11.</p>\n<p>Okay now that we have written our Python C extension, how do\
  \ we package it so that users on all major operating systems can easily install\
  \ it using pip? We'll take a look at how we can build cross-platform wheels for\
  \ Linux, macOS, and Windows and automatically push them to PyPI!</p>"
