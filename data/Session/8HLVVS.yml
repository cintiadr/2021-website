abstract: <p>This talk is going to brief things that can go wrong while running a
  large-scaled data-intensive application for a decade. I will like to share my mistakes
  and aftermath in production. Also, I'll talk about how I remedied what I've done
  and what I learned afterward. This talk will help audiences avoid making the same
  mistakes so they don’t suffer as I did. Audiences may be inspired by this talk and
  help them to build a successful service that stands the test of time.</p>
description: "<p>This talk is going to brief things that can go wrong while running\
  \ a large-scaled data-intensive application for a decade.</p>\n<p>We always want\
  \ to do things right at the very first. Have a magical architecture design, 100%\
  \ test coverage, things like that. However, after running a service for ten years,\
  \ I realize that those things are just the tip of the iceberg. So many Unimaginable\
  \ things can happen in production. </p>\n<p>In this talk, I will like to share my\
  \ mistakes and aftermath in production. Also, I'll talk about how I remedied what\
  \ I've done and what I learned afterward. Due to time limitations, I'll share the\
  \ most \"oops\" ones. This talk will help audiences avoid making the same mistakes\
  \ so they don’t suffer as I did. Audiences may be inspired by this talk and help\
  \ them to build a successful service that stands the test of time.</p>\n<p>Targeted\
  \ audiences: who like stories about running a large-scale service in the real world.</p>\n\
  <p>Audiences are expected to have basic knowledge and experience about backend and\
  \ DevOps.</p>"
