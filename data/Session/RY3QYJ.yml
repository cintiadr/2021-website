abstract: '<p>Sounds, words, reading, writing: this is how many people generally develop
  language skills. In this session, we argue why learning to read code is a game-changer
  in teaching programming to novice learners and highlight some strategies that can
  be utilised to develop code reading skills.</p>'
description: <p>Navigating a text-based programming language for the first time can
  be daunting for many learners. While educators support their students with writing
  code, we argue that learning to read code is equally important. We present some
  of the existing research in this area, highlighting the numerous benefits of learning
  to read code. We highlight some easily accessible ways that educators can develop
  code reading fluency in novice learners, and how these strategies can also provide
  educators with valuable insights into how their learners are developing their knowledge.</p>
